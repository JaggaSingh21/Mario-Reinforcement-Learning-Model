# Mario Reinforcement Learning Model

This project trains a Mario agent using Reinforcement Learning to autonomously navigate and complete levels in the classic Mario environment. By leveraging the OpenAI Gym framework and advanced machine learning techniques, the model learns from its interactions with the environment and improves over time.

## Why This Project is Useful

Reinforcement Learning is a powerful approach to training agents to solve complex tasks through trial and error. In this project, the Mario agent learns to navigate levels, avoid obstacles, and reach goals without explicit instructions. This project demonstrates how AI can be used to tackle real-time decision-making problems, and it serves as a fun introduction to the world of reinforcement learning.

## What You Can Do with This Project

- **Train Mario**: Use reinforcement learning to train Mario to complete levels, learning from rewards and penalties.
- **Analyze Mario's Learning Process**: Understand how the model improves over time by analyzing training metrics and performance.
- **Experiment with Hyperparameters**: Customize the training process by adjusting hyperparameters such as learning rate, number of episodes, and reward functions.
- **Visualize Results**: Create visualizations that showcase Mario's progress and the efficiency of the learning process.

## How It Works

1. **Environment Setup**: The project uses the `gym-super-mario-bros` environment, where Mario interacts with the game world and receives rewards for completing actions that bring him closer to the goal.
2. **Model Training**: The model is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, a popular method for reinforcement learning.
3. **Data Processing**: Training data is processed to evaluate Mario's performance and make adjustments to the model as needed.
4. **Visualize Performance**: The project provides tools to visualize Mario's progress, making it easy to understand how well the model is performing.

## Data Storytelling

Reinforcement learning models often generate vast amounts of data during training. This project emphasizes data storytelling by visualizing key performance metrics and training results. These visualizations help illustrate the learning process and make it easier to explain how the model evolves over time.
